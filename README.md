## **Recreating John Snow&#39;s Ghost Map**

**Project&#39;s source is Datacamp.**

This project explores how Dr.John Snow solved the mystery of the cholera outbreak in London by analyzing the deaths across the neighborhood and found out that the real culprit was a contaminated water pump.

There are two datasets:

Deaths: includes number of deaths and X &amp; Y coordinates

Pumps: includes X &amp; Y coordinates of pumps locations

Dates: includes dates and number of deaths


This notebook does the following:

-Recreates the map that Dr.Snow draw to detect where deaths are centered

-Finding the connection between cholera outbreaks and public water pumps

-Comparing the number of deaths before removing the water pump handle and after
